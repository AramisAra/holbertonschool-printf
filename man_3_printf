PRINTF(3)                 Linux Programmer's Manual                PRINTF(3)

NAME
       _printf - formatted output conversion

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>

       int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION

       The _printf() function writes output to the standard output (stdout)
       according to the format specified by the format string. It is
       equivalent to the printf() function provided by the standard C
       library, with the underscore ('_') prefix.

       The format string is composed of zero or more directives, which are
       either ordinary characters or specifications starting with the percent 
       character ('%'). Each conversion specification defines how a single 
       argument should be formatted and inserted into the output string.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, the _printf() function returns the number
       of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end the
       output). If an output error occurs, a negative value is returned.
       Refer to the printf(3) manual page for more details.

EXAMPLES
       The following example demonstrates the usage of _printf():

           #include <stdio.h>

           int main() {
               _printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
               return 0;
           }

           // Output:
           // Hello, world!

SEE ALSO
       printf(3), sprintf(3), fprintf(3), snprintf(3)

NOTES
       The _printf() function behaves similarly to printf(), supporting
       various format specifiers for different types of arguments such as
       integers, characters, strings, and more.

       Users should be cautious of potential format string vulnerabilities
       when using _printf() and ensure that the format string is properly
       constructed to avoid security risks such as format string attacks.

       The printf(3) manual page provides additional details on the format
       specifiers supported by _printf().
